# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-21), private preview

First tagged release. Installs from git (`bun add -g git+ssh://git@github.com/MarvinAmador7/capcomd.git#v0.2.0`);
needs Bun ≥ 1.4. What works and what's open: [STATUS.md](STATUS.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Orchestration
- **Primitives** (ADR-016): `run new`, `spawn`, `await` / `wait-any`, `cancel` (propagates), `tree`, a task board
  with fenced leases and dependencies (`task add --after`), a versioned kv blackboard, `events --follow`, multi-unit
  budgets (usd, turns, wallSeconds), idempotent `--key` on every write.
- **Sub-agents in VMs** (ADR-017): agents allowed to spawn get the same verbs inside their VM (in-VM CLI and MCP
  tools over the exec channel), with capability tokens, narrow-only fan-out set by the parent, budget carving,
  stuck detection and fencing of agent-written text.
- **Gates**: `verify` runs checks on the branch merged with the latest target; `merge --require` lands only that
  exact commit and re-runs the same checks. Operator-named checks (`run new --checks-set`), pinned per child at
  spawn (`spawn --check`).
- **Reviewer**: `run new --reviewer P`; after the checks pass, a reviewer agent reads the commit (read-only, never
  pushes); checks and review must both pass, no verdict fails. Replaces the old fake-model judge in `verify`.
- **Checks in a VM**: with real agents (boxd), checks run in a throwaway VM, never on the orchestrator host.
- **Report mode** (`spawn --report`), **per-run staging targets** (`run new --target T --target-from BASE`), and
  **approval requests**: an agent's merge into a protected branch waits for `capcomd approve <runId> <mrgId>`.
- **Interface-first** pattern for dependent work (planner guidance + scenario test).

### Agents and environments
- Claude Code and Codex adapters; agent profiles (`capcomd agents …`); subscription logins (`auth login`);
  boxd host-bound secrets (`secrets sync`); env snapshots (`env build`); `doctor`.
- Costs: billed USD plus the API-price estimate for subscription work (`~$0.04`) in `tree`, `budget` and the TUI.

### Observability
- Versioned JSON contract for every command (`--json`, schema `relay.v1`, exit codes), MCP server, traces,
  `inspect --follow` (snapshot, events, tree and trace updates).
- Terminal debugger (`apps/tui`): Live tree with parallel groups, reviewers and per-agent pipelines; Waterfall,
  Timeline, Rollups, Events and Replay views that fill in while a run executes.

### Reliability and CI
- Crash safety: atomic lifecycle transitions, epochs, an outbox, exactly-once merges; chaos killpoint suite and
  strict `chaos:fast`.
- CI runs for the first time (the workflow file had been invalid YAML): typecheck, state machines, the scenario
  suite, killpoints, nightly `chaos:fast`. Tests run on macOS and Linux.

### Upgrade notes
- An **installed** CLI keeps state in `~/.capcomd` (`state/`, `traces/`, `agents.json`), or `$CAPCOMD_HOME`. A git
  checkout of capcomd keeps its old layout (`.relay/`, `.traces/`, `.capcomd/agents.json`). Per-file overrides
  (`CAPCOMD_AUTH_LEDGER`, `CAPCOMD_ENV_LEDGER`, `CAPCOMD_TRACE_DIR`, `CAPCOMD_AGENTS_FILE`, …) still win. A project's
  own `.capcomd/agents.json` (in the current directory) is used when present.
- `verify --judge-profile` is now an alias of `--review-profile` and runs a real reviewer agent; an unknown profile
  is refused.

### Known limitations
- `capcomd run "<goal>"` is **experimental**: its planner and run-level judge still use a fake model. Use the
  primitives for real work.
- A real agent's spend is known only when it finishes; no stacked branches yet (dependent work goes interface
  first); one engine per machine (no Rivet Cloud); no standalone binary yet (`serve` doesn't work compiled).
- `capcomd ui` (the web canvas) isn't part of the package; run it from a checkout.
