# Chaos gate notes (2026-10-18)

## attempt-0: seed 29 (`vm.create.after_request.before_record:1`), resume reported as failed
- Log: `chaos-attempt-0-seed29-failure.log`. The resumed client printed `✓ Run completed successfully` but exited 1.
- Root cause: the old `src/cli/index.ts` never called `process.exit` after a successful command, so the
  process only exited once the event loop drained. A rivetkit `tunnel_request_aborted` retry kept a
  handle open, and the harness's 30s `runClient` timer SIGKILLed the client, which reported `code ?? 1`.
- Fix: the CLI now always exits explicitly with its exit code (`102eb9e`).

## attempt-1: seed 8 (`push.after.before_event:1`), engine never ready after restart
- Log: `chaos-attempt-1-seed8-ready-timeout.log`. The ready probe saw `actor_ready_timeout` for the
  whole 45s window.
- Root cause: the restarted engine sometimes never registers its runner. That's a readiness
  problem, not data loss or an invariant failure.
- Fix: `Engine.start` cold-restarts the engine on the same data dir (no wipe) up to twice, and logs
  `engine-not-ready attempt=N` (`61e9a7b`). In run 1 it fired twice, once for `actor_ready_timeout`
  and once for `internal_error`, and that case then passed.

## Gate runs (tree 61e9a7b, runner /workspace/chaos3.sh)
- Run 1: 10/10 killpoints, 50/50 seeds, exit 0 (`chaos-run-1.log`).
- Runs 2 and 3: see `chaos-run-2.log` and `chaos-run-3.log`.
